# Computer-vision-ML-project
This is a project to detect face and eyes of the people 
I have randomly downloaded an image from google for this project
I Resized the image size to make it fit for my resolution
I imported CV2 Module to use CascadeClassifier
I used haarcascade_frontalface and haarcascade_eye to detect face and eye from the image.
